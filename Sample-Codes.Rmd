This is where I will house sample code I have either figured out on own or with help from the internet.

Use the following in a code chunk when wanting to add a value from a function to a title (especially in th elabs function):
paste("Average = ", avg_trainers, sep = "")

Use the following when wanting to run code based on whether or not a variable exists:
number_highend <- if (any(na.omit(aes_inclusion_comments == 5|6|7))) {
  aes_inclusion_comments %>%
    filter(id_trainer %in% c("5", "6", "7")) %>%
    count(quarter) %>%
    pull(n)
} else {
  print("0")
}

Another way to do the above:
number_positive <- if (sum(str_detect(aes_inclusion_comments$id_code, ".1$")) > 0) {
  aes_inclusion_comments %>%
    filter(str_detect(id_code, ".1")) %>%
    distinct(id_comment, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
    count(quarter) %>%
    pull(n)
} else {
  print("0")
}
